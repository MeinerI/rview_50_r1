This is the source code for TurboPascal's Rview.

Rview is a program to modify the rooms in classic Tomb Raider PC games (TR1 - TR5).

It is the source code for version 5 revision 1 and not the last version released, 5 revision 3, so some features will be missing.

Originally downloaded from author's defunct geocities website. (See http://www.geocities.ws/cyber_delphi/)

Initial commit is original Delphi 7 code which will need updating for modern Delphi IDEs.

Project search paths will also need to be changed to search for units in the opengl, shared and trunit2 directories.
